# T460s-OpenCore-IntelWifi
Install MacOS Catalina 10.15.6 on T460s laptops with built-in Intel Wireless.

***

## Introduction

This will allow you to install and use macOS + OpenCore on any T460s model, with working [Intel Wireless and Bluetooth](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless). Please note that this is experimental and still under development, so *it may be unstable or upright not working.*
Repo is updated regularly and I plan on mantaining it for a long time. 

If you're new to this I suggest reading [Dortania's](https://dortania.github.io) guide on how to install macOS. This OC configuration may work for you but you'd be better off learning how it works and rebuilding your configuration & SSDTs. 

Thanks to [acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera) for OpenCore, [mszturc](https://github.com/MSzturc) for ThinkPad keyboard patches and [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless) for Intel BT+Wifi implementation on macOS. 

Grazie a [simprecicchiani](https://github.com/simprecicchiani) for being the first to host a OC repo for T460s.

## So how do I do it?

*MAKE SURE YOUR LAPTOP BIOS IS UPDATED TO THE LATEST VERSION*
